# ace-entities
This repo contains the entities of the ACE framework, i.e., the Authorization Server (AceAS), the Resource Server (AceRS), and the Client (AceClient). They use the extended ACE library, which uses the Usage Control for decision making, and implements the revoked notification mechanism for communicating to RSs and Clients about revoked access tokens
